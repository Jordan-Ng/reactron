# Naive Implementation of React library for UI rendering

This is a naive implementation of the React library for two of the most used react hooks (useState, useEffect). The idea behind this implementation is such that for an electron app, you could just import this file in and interact with the DOM as you would in React, without having to download the full React library.

However, there is clearly a skill issue here so it cannot be completed. But hey, I tried! and I learnt a bunch of cool stuff about how these hooks under the hood :)

**p.s: please do not use this. This was developed to support another app, and this repo has been made public to show that there was an attempt in developing the React Library. It's been months since I worked on this, so I cannot vouch for the correctness.
